HOSTING READINESS CHECK REPORT
==============================

The following issues were identified which may cause "500 Server Error" or "Page Not Found" errors when hosting this Laravel application on a Linux server (which is case-sensitive), unlike your local Windows environment.

1. CRITICAL: View Directory Case Sensitivity
--------------------------------------------
Your `resources/views` directory contains a folder named `Admin` (Capitalized).
However, your controllers reference it using lowercase `admin`. This works on Windows but WILL FAIL on Linux.

- File: `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/ProductController.php`
  - Current: `return view('admin.products.index'...)`
  - Error: Linux cannot find folder `admin` because it is named `Admin`.
  - Fix: Rename folder `resources/views/Admin` to `resources/views/admin` (Recommended) OR change code to `view('Admin.products.index')`.

- File: `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/OrderController.php`
  - Current: `return view('Admin.oders'...)`
  - Observation: This uses `Admin` (Correct case) but has a filename typo (see below).

2. Filename Typos
-----------------
- File: `resources/views/Admin/oders.blade.php`
  - Issue: Misspelled "orders" as "oders".
  - Code Reference: `OrderController.php` calls `view('Admin.oders')`.
  - Fix: Rename file to `orders.blade.php` and update Controller to `view('admin.orders')`.

3. Route Caching (Deployment Optimization)
------------------------------------------
Your routes files contain "Closures" (anonymous functions) instead of pointing to Controllers. This prevents you from running `php artisan route:cache` during deployment, which is a standard performance formulation.

- File: `routes/web.php` (Line 38)
  - Code: `Route::get('/user/profile', function () { ... })`
  - Fix: Move logic to a Controller.

- File: `routes/api.php` (Line 26)
  - Code: `Route::get('/user', function (Request $request) { ... })`
  - Fix: Move logic to a Controller.

4. Image Paths (Verified)
-------------------------
- Image paths in code generally look correct now (`images/...`).
- Ensure the public folder on the server is named `images` (lowercase).

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
-------------------
1. Rename folder `resources/views/Admin` -> `resources/views/admin`.
2. Rename folder `resources/views/Pages` -> `resources/views/pages`.
3. Rename file `resources/views/Admin/oders.blade.php` -> `resources/views/admin/orders.blade.php`.
4. Update `OrderController.php` to return `view('admin.orders', ...)`
5. Update `ProductsController.php` (Public) to return `view('pages.index', ...)` instead of `Pages.index`.
