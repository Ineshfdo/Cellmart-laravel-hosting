HOSTING COMPATIBILITY FIX REPORT
================================

I have successfully fixed the issues that would prevent your Laravel application from running correctly on a Linux server (hosting environment).

FIXES APPLIED
-------------

1. View Directory & Filename Standardization (Case Sensitivity)
   - Renamed folder `resources/views/Admin` to `resources/views/admin`.
   - Renamed folder `resources/views/Pages` to `resources/views/pages`.
   - Renamed file `resources/views/admin/oders.blade.php` to `resources/views/admin/orders.blade.php` (Fixed Typo).

2. Controller Updates (Consistent naming)
   - Updated `OrderController.php`, `CustomerController.php`, `UserController.php` to reference views using `admin.` prefix.
   - Updated `ProductsController.php`, `ContactController.php`, `AboutController.php`, `CartController.php`, `CheckoutController.php` to reference views using `pages.` prefix.
   - Fixed the specific 500 Error cause: `OrderController` calling `Admin.oders` is now correctly calling `admin.orders`.

3. Route Optimization (500 Error Prevention)
   - Refactored `routes/web.php` to use `Route::view` instead of a closure for the profile page.
   - Refactored `routes/api.php` to use a Controller method (`UserController@me`) instead of a closure.
   - RESULT: You can now safely run `php artisan route:cache` on your server without errors.

NEXT STEPS FOR YOU
------------------
1. When you deploy, ensure you run:
   php artisan config:cache
   php artisan route:cache
   php artisan view:cache

2. Your `public/images` folder should also be lowercase on the server (it is already correct in your code).

Your application is now fully compatible with Linux hosting environments.
